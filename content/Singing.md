I have been deeply immersed in Hindustani Classical vocal music and harmonium accompaniment for over 14 years. This journey has allowed me to develop a strong foundation in classical ragas, intricate melodic improvisation, and the nuanced interplay between voice and harmonium. My training encompasses a wide repertoire, including khayal, ragas, and devotional music, highlighting my versatility and dedication to this art form.

Over the years, I have had the privilege of performing and accompanying in a variety of settings, including intimate gatherings, formal events, charity concerts, and beyond. A few of my notable performances and accompaniment experiences include are attached below.

Through these experiences, I have cultivated not only my technical skills but also a deep appreciation for the rich traditions of Hindustani music and its ability to connect with audiences on a profound level.
