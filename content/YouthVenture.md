**PDX Business Spotlight** is a cornerstone initiative of **YouthVenture**, a youth-led nonprofit dedicated to empowering and uplifting the BIPOC community. Our mission is to celebrate the vibrant stories, resilience, and contributions of BIPOC-owned small businesses in the Portland and Beaverton areas through authentic storytelling and community engagement. 

As the founder and executive director of YouthVenture, I:

- Produce and host the _PDX Business Spotlight_ podcast, which highlights the stories of over 45 local BIPOC-owned businesses.
- Engage an audience of 800+ listeners and readers through both podcasts and blogs, fostering awareness and support for these vital community contributors.

### Why We Started

During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, BIPOC-owned businesses faced disproportionate challenges, from declining sales to adapting to virtual platforms. Recognizing the urgent need for support and visibility, our team of passionate youth created the **PDX Business Spotlight** podcast. What began as a platform to amplify local voices has grown into a movement to advocate for economic equity and celebrate the entrepreneurial spirit of these businesses.

### What We Do

Through over 5 seasons and 40+ episodes, **PDX Business Spotlight** shares the inspiring journeys of local BIPOC business ownersâ€”their struggles, triumphs, and the innovative ways they have navigated adversity. Each episode offers listeners a closer look at the people behind the businesses and highlights their unique contributions, from food and fashion to self-care and beyond.

### Our Impact

- **Increased Awareness**: Our podcast reaches hundreds of listeners, raising awareness of the stories and products offered by BIPOC entrepreneurs.
- **Community Support**: By encouraging listeners to shop locally and support featured businesses, we foster economic growth and sustainability in our community.
- **Advocacy for Equity**: Beyond storytelling, we are committed to creating a more equitable business ecosystem for all.
